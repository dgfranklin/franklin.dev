I'm a software engineer based out of Seattle working on [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/registrar).

I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu) in Pittsburgh. 

Previously, I've worked on:

- [Apple's Numbers, a part of iWork](https://www.apple.com/numbers/)
